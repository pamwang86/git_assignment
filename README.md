a. What is an issue?

GitHub Issues are items you can create in a repository to plan, discuss and track work.

Issues are simple to create and flexible to suit a variety of scenarios. You can use issues to track work, give or receive feedback, collaborate on ideas or tasks, and efficiently communicate with others.

b. What is a pull request?

Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.

c. How do I open up a pull request?
When you add a pull request template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template's contents in the pull request body.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

1.Ask for the username of the person you're inviting as a collaborator. If they don't have a username yet, they can sign up for GitHub. For more information, see "Creating an account on GitHub."

2.On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

3.Under your repository name, click  Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the  dropdown menu, then click Settings.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is Version Control System,it take the snapshots of the changed lines.
Github is a platform that allows people create, store, manage and share their code.

f. What does git diff do?
A diff is the difference in changes between two commits, or saved changes. The diff will visually describe what was added or removed from a file since its last commit.

g. What is the main branch?
When you create a repository with content on GitHub.com, GitHub creates the repository with a single branch. TBesides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
his first branch in the repository is the default branch. The default branch is the branch that GitHub displays when anyone visits your repository. The default branch is also the initial branch that Git checks out locally when someone clones the repository. Unless you specify a different branch, the default branch in a repository is the base branch for new pull requests and code commits.
By default, GitHub names the default branch main in any new repository.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No.
